For this project, I would like to create a program that recognizes ASL hand symbols and converts the letters found into text.

The databases linked in the assignment provide a good training set for this project, especially this database: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/etvr4ybglp2deq2/AAChVx5bKrsQ-ougGyEsXrs7a?dl=0
In additon, I have added links to a few other useful datasets to be used for training or testing:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danrasband/asl-alphabet-test

For this project, there are quite a few computer-vision topics I must learn about, which I have listed below:
- detection of human hand
  - detection should differentiate hand from background
  - should this detection differentiate between a drawing of the symbol and a real human hand?
- detection of hand placement in the frame
  - is the hand fully in frame and visible?
- determining where the tip of each finger is placed
  - possibly based on the curves of the finger tips
- differentiation between similar asl hand symbols
