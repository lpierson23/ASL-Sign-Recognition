# ASL-Sign-Recognition

To run code on validation sample:
- Download "Validation" ZIP file into Google Drive
- Open CV_Part4_Classification.ipynb code in Google CoLabs
- Replace imagesPath on line 12 of the last code section with the location of your validation images
- Run each cell in the CV_Part4_Classification.ipynb as usual


I had some problems adding a copy of the code to the repo. If the file doesn't work, please use this link https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13rJ_OMREkkH8hDy5aMXzhcVaz6_U7KbQ?usp=sharing
